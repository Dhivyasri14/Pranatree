What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
NLP is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, 
and respond to human language.

Tokenization:
Splits text into smaller chunks like words or sentences.
Ex: " NLP is Interesting"  O/p: ["NLP","is","Interesting"]

Stemming: 
Stemming reduces words to their root form, often by chopping off prefixes/suffixes.
Ex: "Heating" o/p:["Heat"]

Lemmatization:
Lemmatization reduces words to their base form using linguistic rules.
Ex: words=["runner","better","geese"]  o/p:["run","good","goose"]

Stop words:
Stop words are common words in a language (e.g., "is", "the", "and") that often appear in text but carry little meaning. 
They are usually removed during text preprocessing to focus on the important words in the text.

Tokens (words):
['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'a', 'fascinating', 'field', 'of', 'AI']
Filtered Tokens:
['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'fascinating', 'field', 'AI']

Sentiment Analysis:
TextBlob can analyze the sentiment of text, providing:

Polarity:
Measures the emotional tone of the text, indicating whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
Range: Polarity is a value between -1 and +1:
+1: Extremely positive sentiment.
0: Neutral sentiment.
-1: Extremely negative sentiment.
Use Case:
Helps businesses understand customer feedback. For example:
"The product is amazing!" → Polarity = +0.8 (positive).
"I hate this experience." → Polarity = -0.9 (negative).

Subjectivity:
Measures how much of the text expresses personal opinion, emotion, or bias versus objective facts.
Range: Subjectivity is a value between 0 and 1:
0: Completely objective (fact-based).
1: Highly subjective (opinion-based).
for example,
"The car is red and has four doors." → Subjectivity = 0.2 (objective).
"I love how stylish this car looks!" → Subjectivity = 0.9 (subjective).
