Zero-shot Prompting:
    Zero-shot prompting involves giving the AI a task or query without providing any examples or prior context. 
    The model relies solely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response.

Example:
Prompt:
"Write a short poem about the moon."

Response:
"The moonlight glows, a silvery sheen,
Lighting the night with a mystical gleam.
High in the sky, serene and bright,
A beacon of wonder in the quiet night."

Few-shot Prompting:
    Few-shot prompting provides the AI with a small number of examples (typically 1–5) to guide its 
    understanding of the task.
Example:
Prompt:
Translate the following to Spanish:

Hello → Hola
Thank you → Gracias
Good morning → Buenos días.


Chain-of-Thought Prompting:
    Chain-of-thought prompting involves instructing the AI to generate step-by-step reasoning or intermediate 
    explanations while solving a problem.
    This method improves the accuracy of tasks requiring logical reasoning, calculations, or decision-making.

Example:
Prompt:
"If a store sells 3 apples for $1 and I buy 12 apples, how much will it cost?."

Response:
"3 apples cost $1.
12 apples = 4 sets of 3 apples.
4 sets × $1 = $4.
The total cost is $4."
