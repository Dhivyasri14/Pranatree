Vector Embeddings:
    Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text (or other data types) in high-dimensional space,
    where similar items are closer together.
    Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of data, which allows for more effective similarity searches.
Common Techniques:
    OpenAI's Embeddings
    Sentence-Transformers
Pinecone
    Pinecone is a vector database that helps manage and search high-dimensional vector data, 
    designed for use cases like similarity search and recommendation systems.

Similarity Search:
    A method to find data points that are semantically or structurally similar to a given query.

    Converts data (e.g., text, images) into vector embeddings.
    Computes similarity between embeddings using metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, 
    or dot product.

Sentence-Transformers:
    Sentence-Transformers is a Python library designed to generate high-quality embeddings for sentences,
    paragraphs, and documents.
